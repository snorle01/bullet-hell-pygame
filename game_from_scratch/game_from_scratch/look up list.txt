Radians in 360deg (approx) = 6.283
to make the bullet aimed at the player angle_offset must be 0

circle = "bullets":20, "angle_offset":0.31415, "angle_spread":0.31415
to make circle divide the radians with the number of bullets and put that number on angle offset and angle spread

trident = "bullets":3, "angle_offset":-0.4, "angle_spread":0.2
