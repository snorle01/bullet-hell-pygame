# bullet-hell-pygame
a bullet hell i made in pygame (its not done yet)

you need pygame and python to run the game
by changing the variable named json_file_stage in main_file.py you can change the starting level. remember to change the varible stage_level too. (i might forget to change it to stage1.json and might leave it as test.json)

to start the game click the main_file.py
