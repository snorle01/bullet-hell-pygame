# bullet-hell-pygame
a bullet hell i made in pygame (its not done yet)

you need pygame and python to run the game
by changing the variable named json_file_stage in main_file.py you can change the starting level. remember to change the varible stage_level too. (i might forget to change it to stage1.json and might leave it as test.json)

to start the game click the main_file.py

# how to play
move with the arrow keys.
press z to shoot.
press x to bomb (only bomb if you are about to get hit by a bullet).
hold shift to make you go slower and to show your hitbox (your hitbox is the small red dot).
